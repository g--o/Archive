============

DISCLAIMER: this code is really bad, I advise using as an example only and not copying this awful thing to any codebase.

Background
========

When I was just starting highschool I was really enthused to program
things I was curious at the time as to how they'd work.

These are some survivors of these projects that might still be useful as they often contain
obscure sections of c++ programming like:

- making a directx game engine/library (only lib used is XAnimator by Keith Ditchburn
- making an actual "game" (driving a car) with the frameworks i made
- making graphical interface programs via code (windows api)
- downloading files + ftp management with windows libs only.

The game dev projects
===============
While today these things aren't really relevant, at the time making games with engines was expensive
and if you wanted to be indie you had to make your own frameworks, with dominating language being c++.
Being the pretentious brat kid that I was, I decided to learn trig and simple matrix arithmetic to make my engine.
This was my magnum opus.

The graphical projects
===============
This was actually a personal interest to see more clearly how .NET framework actually works behind the curtains.
Examples were extremely rare and after making a small framework my tiny kid brain finally realized this abstraction was already done for me
and how the pieces fit from the API to the .NET graphical editor.

Notes
=====
There are no executables unfortunately because at the time I used a lot of models / resources that I didn't make (except for the engine),
In these cases I attached screenshots that will hopefully make things clearer.
